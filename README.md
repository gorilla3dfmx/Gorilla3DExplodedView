# ExplodedView
The demo application showing how to implement an exploded view with Gorilla3D Firemonkey 3D Addon-Framework.
Exploded views are need to allow users to display complex models with sub-meshes in a different manner, by
exploding the single parts from the model center.

The demo is working properly since Gorilla3D v1.1.9. This demo should also work with a Gorilla3D BASIC package.
